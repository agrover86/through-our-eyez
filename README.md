# GTH-Location- Through Our Eyes
Project submission for the `Global Travel Hackathon in [Location], by [team-name] team`.

**Write one sentence explaining what does your project.**

Our project is a walking audio guide that uses Google chatbot interface to select different journeys through a city according to a user's interest. This data is then sent to a Python Backend and finally a Google map with a planned journey and an mp3 audio are sent back to the user. So they can follow their own route through the destination.
